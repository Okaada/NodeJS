# Node JS and MongoDB Learning 

## This application doesn't have any layout, so I strongly recommend that you use Insomnia


At this project I started to study Node.
Isn't adavanced stuff but there are essencial principles 
Here, you will have a CRUD (Projects Controller) working with a Bearer Token to authenticate.

Until now, I'm using Express, Mongoose, BodyParser, JWT, BCrypt, Nodemailer, Nodemailer-Express-Handlebars, fs and path.

Appreciate if you tell me anything important that I need to know :)

Thanks!
