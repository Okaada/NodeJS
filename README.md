# Node JS and MongoDB Learning 

At this project I started to study Node.
Isn't adavanced stuff but there are essencial principles 

Until now, I'm using Express, Mongoose, BodyParser, JWT, BCrypt, Nodemailer, Nodemailer-Express-Handlebars, fs and path.

Appreciate if you tell me anything important that I need to know :)
